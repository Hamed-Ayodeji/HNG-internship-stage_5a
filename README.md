## Introduction

Imagine you're a chef in a bustling kitchen. You need to know what ingredients you have, what's cooking, and who's doing what. Now, picture your server as that kitchen. **DevOpsFetch** is like your trusty kitchen assistant, giving you all the important information about your server at your fingertips.

**DevOpsFetch** is a comprehensive tool designed for DevOps professionals and system administrators. It serves as a one-stop solution for gathering and monitoring critical server information, including active ports, Docker containers, Nginx configurations, user logins, and system activities.

## What Makes DevOpsFetch Special?

1. **Cross-Distribution Compatibility:** Works seamlessly across various Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Arch Linux, and openSUSE. It automatically detects the package manager used by your system and installs the required tools accordingly.

2. **Unified Tool:** Consolidates functionality into a single command-line interface, simplifying the process of obtaining server information and making management easier.

3. **Readable Output:** Presents information in clean, organized tables, ensuring data is easy to interpret and understand.

4. **Continuous Monitoring:** Can run as a background service, continuously monitoring and reporting on server status without manual intervention.

5. **Efficient Logging:** Includes intelligent log management with automatic log rotation and compression to manage disk usage effectively.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing DevOpsFetch, ensure you have the following:

- Access to a terminal with superuser privileges.
- The `install.sh` and `devopsfetch.sh` scripts.

### Steps

1. **Download the Scripts:**
   - Ensure you have `install.sh` and `devopsfetch.sh` on your server.

2. **Make the Installation Script Executable:**

    ```bash
    chmod +x install.sh
    ```

3. **Run the Installation Script:**

    ```bash
    sudo ./install.sh
    ```

The `install.sh` script performs the following:

- **Dependency Check and Installation:** Detects your Linux distribution, installs necessary tools, and handles package management.
- **Script Deployment:** Copies `devopsfetch.sh` to `/usr/local/bin` for global access.
- **Service Configuration:** Sets up a systemd service to run DevOpsFetch as a background process.
- **Log Rotation Setup:** Configures log rotation to manage log files and prevent excessive disk space usage.
